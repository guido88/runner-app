I implemented the document structure , adding some style and JS function.

- 'Start Race' button initiates the clock
- 'End Race' stops it

-Clicking on the Name ,it updates the Lap Count.

Unfortunately i could not implement timer calculations as i had issues with date object and i could not figure it out 
what was the issue in time.
